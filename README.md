<h1>Secret Auction</h1>

<p>The Secret Auction game is a simple game where players bid on an item without knowing the bids of the other players. The player with the highest bid wins the item.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can download the code files from the repository and launch the game from your terminal or IDE by running main.py</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>When you run the Secret Auction game, you will be prompted to enter your name and the amount you wish to bid for an item up for auction. You will not be able to see the bids of other players. If there are other players bidding, you will be prompted to enter their names and bids as well. Each player's bid will remain secret throughout the game. After all bidders have entered their bids, the game will reveal the winner with the highest bid. The winner will be declared, and the game will end.
<p>If you wish to play another round, you can choose to start a new auction by typing "yes" when prompted. Otherwise, type "no" to end the game.</p>
<p>That's it! Have fun playing the Secret Auction game!</p>
